Zahidul Haque is a prospective graduate student for Fall 2024. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET). He is intrigued by research and innovation in the intersection of Renewable Energy and Machine Learning. 

**Professional Experience**  
- Internship, [BPDB](https://bpdb.gov.bd/){:target="_blank"} (2022): I have gained practical knowledge of power generation, transmission, and distribution systems during my one-month industrial attachment at the Bangladesh Power Development Board. I have visited and observed the operation and maintenance of the Barapukuria Coal Mining Limited and the Barapukuria Coal Power Plant in Dinajpur.  

**Research Experience**

Review & Economic Analysis of a Solar Powered Water Pumping System for Crop Irrigation - This research paper evaluates and compares a solar powered water pumping system (SPWPS) with a conventional diesel powered water pumping system (DPWPS) for crop irrigation. The paper uses technical, environmental, and economic criteria to assess the feasibility and performance of the SPWPS, and develops a mathematical model to estimate its cost based on the irrigation needs and solar radiation data. The paper shows that the SPWPS is a viable and sustainable option for irrigation in remote areas where grid electricity is scarce or unreliable.

**Projects**
- Automatic street light system based on Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR): Designed and implemented a circuit that uses an LDR and a transistor to control the switching of street lights based on the ambient light intensity.
- Design and fabrication of a hydraulic ram pump: Developed and tested a device that uses the energy of flowing water to pump water to a higher elevation without any external power source.
- Automatic braking system using fuzzy logic: Implemented and simulated a system that can automatically apply brakes to a vehicle based on the distance and speed of the obstacle ahead.
- Solar-powered refrigeration system using adsorption technology: Designed and constructed a prototype of a refrigeration system that uses solar energy to produce cooling effect.



**Hobbies**  
- Reading, Gaming
