**Research Experience**

**Review & Economic Analysis of a Solar Powered Water Pumping System for Crop Irrigation** - This research paper evaluates and compares a solar powered water pumping system (SPWPS) with a conventional diesel powered water pumping system (DPWPS) for crop irrigation. The paper uses technical, environmental, and economic criteria to assess the feasibility and performance of the SPWPS, and develops a mathematical model to estimate its cost based on the irrigation needs and solar radiation data. The paper shows that the SPWPS is a viable and sustainable option for irrigation in remote areas where grid electricity is scarce or unreliable.

**[Integration of Geothermal and Run-of-River Hydroelectric Systems: A Hybrid Renewable Energy Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ileob_6KY_FsMPb8gJwrQeLlaIAfDLBu/view){:target="_blank"} (Under Review)** - This research explores the innovative integration of geothermal and run-of-river hydroelectric systems to create a hybrid renewable energy model that addresses the challenges of energy intermittency and sustainability. By combining geothermal energyâ€™s stable baseload with the seasonal adaptability of run-of-river
hydroelectricity, the study demonstrates a balanced approach to renewable power generation. Utilizing river water for cooling enhances thermal efficiency, reduces thermal pollution, and lowers infrastructure costs through shared resources. The research also provides a comprehensive analysis of site selection, system design, heat exchanger optimization, and environmental benefits, particularly the preservation of aquatic ecosystems through controlled water return. Emphasizing grid stability and economic feasibility, the study identifies this hybrid model as a viable solution for regions rich in geothermal and hydrological resources, offering a sustainable pathway to reliable and low-carbon energy generation.


**Professional Experience**  
- Internship, [BPDB](https://bpdb.gov.bd/){:target="_blank"} (2022): Zahidul Haque has gained practical knowledge of power generation, transmission, and distribution systems during a one-month industrial attachment at the Bangladesh Power Development Board. He visited and observed the operation and maintenance of the Barapukuria Coal Mining Limited and the Barapukuria Coal Power Plant in Dinajpur.  

**Projects**
- **Automatic street light system based on Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR)**:  Designed and implemented a circuit that uses an LDR and a transistor to control the switching of street lights based on the ambient light intensity.
- **Design and fabrication of a hydraulic ram pump**:  Developed and tested a device that uses the energy of flowing water to pump water to a higher elevation without any external power source.
- **Automatic braking system using fuzzy logic**:  Implemented and simulated a system that can automatically apply brakes to a vehicle based on the distance and speed of the obstacle ahead.
- **Solar-powered refrigeration system using adsorption technology**:  Designed and constructed a prototype of a refrigeration system that uses solar energy to produce cooling effect.
